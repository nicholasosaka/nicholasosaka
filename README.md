### Hi, I'm Nikko ðŸ‘‹ (he/him)
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Philosophy at UNC Charlotte. Currently, I'm a research assistant for a machine learning lab and a teaching assistant for Intro to Natural Language Processing (ITCS 4111).

Find me reading books or drinking coffee.

* ðŸŒ±  I'm currently learning about cloud infrastructure and the intersection with machine learning pipelines.
