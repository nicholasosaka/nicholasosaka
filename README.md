### Hi, I'm Nikko 👋
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Philosophy at UNC Charlotte. Find me reading books or drinking coffee.

* 🔨  I’m working on Spezia, a mobile, social, health-focused recipebook powered with machine learning.
* 🌱  I’m learning modern algebra and more philosophy this semester, taking the time I'd spend on CS courses to do CS research.
* 🖋️  I'm currently writing a piece on the culture of NFTs: asset ownership and metapolitics of digital tokens.
* 💬  Ask me about how philosophy is incredibly useful for a computer scientist!
