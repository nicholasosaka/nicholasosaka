### Hi, I'm Nikko 👋

I'm a data platform engineer and writer. I write about Asian/-American feminism, and philosophy of technology. I build infrastructure on Amazon EMR and EC2 for big data processing pipelines.

See my latest [resume](https://nosaka.xyz/resume) and [CV](https://nosaka.xyz/cv).

I use [they/them/theirs pronouns](https://pronouns.org/what-and-why).

Find me reading books or drinking coffee.
