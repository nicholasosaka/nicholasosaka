### Hi, I'm Nikko ðŸ‘‹
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Philosophy at UNC Charlotte. Find me reading books or drinking coffee.

ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m currently working on Spezia, a mobile, social, health-focused recipebook powered with machine learning.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning natural language processing and machine learning, among other courses.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how Philosophy is incredibly useful for a computer scientist!
