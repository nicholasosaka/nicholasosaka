### Hi, I'm Nikko ðŸ‘‹ (they/he)
Iâ€™m a graduate student studying Philosophy in the Ethics & Applied Philosophy program at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am interested in philosophy of technology, in particular as we can intersect problems of artificial intelligence/machine learning with the social and political, through the lens of feminist philosophy, queer and trans philosophy, crip philosophy, Asian-American diasporic philosophy, and social/political philosophy broadly.

I'm also a solution architect.

Find me reading books or drinking coffee.
